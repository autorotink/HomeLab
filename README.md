# Build a Home Lab
_I've worked with virtual machines before in VMWare...particularly with my AntiSyphon training.  I've also used Kali in VMWare for work, with plenty of guided instruction.  
I feel pretty confident with parts of that.  But I wanted to document the steps for building a home lab following YouTuber @MyDFIR.  There are other resources out there, but I like this guy (as well as many others)!  I'm documenting my progress to keep me accountable too!
MyDFIR has a whole Cybersecurity Projects Playlist! (HUZZAH!) [Cybersecurity Projects - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ)_

_Also, as I run through the steps, I tend to have a lot of different thoughts running through my brain, you'll see those annotated with a squirrel üêøÔ∏è.  Feel free to skip those guys, or read them!_

# HOME LAB

## Objective
To build a functional home lab environment that demonstrates foundational skills. The project, inspired by tutorials from YouTuber @MyDFIR, aims to simulate real-world scenarios, showcase technical proficiency, and enhance my resume with practical experience in setting up and managing a home lab. This project includes configuring a network of virtual machines, deploying essential forensic tools, and documenting processes and findings in a GitHub repository.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Download the hypervisor VirtualBox to host Virtual Machines. 
- Download and install Windows10 and Kali as VMs within VirtualBox.
- Download 7-Zip in order to extract Kali file.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
